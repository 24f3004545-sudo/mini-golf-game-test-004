# mini-golf-game-test-004

## Project Brief
Create a single HTML/CSS/JS application that implements a simple 2D mini-golf game viewable on a single canvas or div. The user must be able to click and drag away from the ball to set the power and direction of the shot. The ball must move based on simple momentum and stop after a few seconds. Include a score counter for the number of strokes taken.
